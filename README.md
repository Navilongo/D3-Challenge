# Data Journalism with D3

## Background
I've been contracted to work at the newsroom, and this is where we need to show what we've got. 

**First order of business: Visualization!**

We want to write a piece in which we discuss the trends that "shape people's lives", amongst them we have data that support
the relationships between people's income, health, where they fit in the poverty line, age and other demographics. 

The data that I will use, coming from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sytem, will show
in an easy to digest scatter plot, the relationship between people living in poverty and how the percentage that have a lack of decent
healthcare.
